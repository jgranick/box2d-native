Box2D (Native)
=============

This is an NME extension to use the native Box2D C++ library.

I am using BuildHX to generate both the Haxe classes and the "ExternalInterface.cpp" file which provides the glue between Haxe and the native Box2D classes. This library will continue to improve as BuildHX handles the generation for more types.
